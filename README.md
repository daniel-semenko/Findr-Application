## Project

Though many students falsely assume that only professors or graduate students
are involved in research, there are many research opportunities at WSU EECS for
undergraduate students. Usually, faculty present the research opportunities in
their classes and students who are interested in the project directly contact
the faculty. However, if the faculty is not teaching a lower-level course, they
canâ€™t easily reach out to sophomore and junior cohorts. There is a need for an
online platform that will allow the faculty advertise their research positions
and connect them with the qualified undergraduate students.
